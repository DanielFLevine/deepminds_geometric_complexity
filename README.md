# deepminds_geometric_complexity

Experiments with geometric complexity from [DeepMind's paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13083). We want to analyze the L2 size of coefficients in a model, and compare it with the value obtained from geometric complexity. This analysis seems to be ommitted from the paper, and it may be simpler and more efficient to use instead of computing Jacobians of networks with many nonlinearities.
